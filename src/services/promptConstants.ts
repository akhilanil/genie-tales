    {
      "pageNumber": 1,
      "story": "The story content in markdown format",
      "illustrationPrompt": "Detailed description for generating an illustration"
    },
    {
      "pageNumber": 2,
      "story": "More story content...",
      "illustrationPrompt": "Another illustration description"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## Requirements

1. The output MUST be valid JSON following the exact structure above
2. All story content MUST be formatted in markdown
3. The story MUST strictly adhere to the provided parameters
4. Each page MUST include an illustration prompt that describes a scene from that page
5. Illustration prompts should be detailed enough to generate a clear visual

  ## IMAGE GENERATION SYSTEM

  You are an AI image generator specializing in children's book illustrations. Create an illustration based on the specific prompt and story details provided below. The image should be age-appropriate, visually engaging, and consistent with the story parameters.

  ## STORY PARAMETERS

  - Age Range: ${ageRange}
  - Theme: ${theme}

  ${illustrationPrompt}

  ## GUIDELINES FOR THIS ILLUSTRATION

  CREATE AN AGE-APPROPRIATE STYLE:
  - For toddlers (1-3): Simple, bold shapes with bright colors
  - For preschool (3-5): Colorful, friendly imagery with clear subjects
  - For early-readers (5-7): Detailed scenes with clear visual storytelling
  - For middle-grade (8-12): More complex compositions with nuanced details

  ENSURE CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
  - Depict {characterName} as described in the parameters
  - Express their traits ({characterTraits}) through posture and expression
  - Make the character recognizable and consistent with the story

  FOCUS ON VISUAL STORYTELLING:
  - Capture the key moment described in the illustration prompt
  - Include environmental details that support the story setting
  - Use color and composition to convey the appropriate mood

  The image should be in landscape orientation, suitable for a children's book page, with no text overlay. Create a vivid, engaging illustration that brings this moment in the story to life for young readers.
